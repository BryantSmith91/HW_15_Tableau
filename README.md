# Unexplained Phenomena

The first unexplained phenomena I encountered can be seen below.  There is an excess of user registrations of unknown gender totaling about 1,547,272 (as seen in the below image) that have a birth year of 1969.  A possible explanation for this is that this is the default gender and birth year of registrations or what a new registration form auto populates to.

This is around the Fordham neighborhood.
